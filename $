	"Good job! You must have a PhD in typing."
	"Impressive! You're one command away from world domination."

	"What do you think this is, a magic terminal that can execute any random command you throw at it?"
	"Are you trying to break the terminal with your ridiculous command-pasting habits?"
	"You can't just copy and paste random commands from the internet and expect them to work."
	"Do you even know what the commands you're pasting in do, or are you just blindly hoping they'll work?"
	"Pasting in commands from the internet doesn't make you a hacker, it just makes you lazy."
	"I'm not a genie that can make any random command you paste work."
	"I think it's time to retire your copy-paste finger and try actually typing out commands."
	"I'm not a fan of your copy-pasting habits. Try typing out a real command for once."
	"Do you even know what you're doing, or are you just blindly pasting commands from the internet?"
	"Maybe try actually understanding what the commands you're running do before you execute them."
	"Seriously? You expect me to run that command? I'm not that gullible."
